  <blockquote> This image shows a one-point perspective sketch of the front
    of the Plains Art Museum. It exemplifies atmospheric perspective, texture,
    and different values.</blockquote></li>
<li>  <img src="landscape_project.jpg" alt="Wooden landscape project">
  <blockquote> On this project, the assignment
    was to create a landscape out of book pages,
    create a measuring device to measure the contours,
    and create a new contour model made of wood. This
    was my group's finished product! </blockquote></li>
<li>  <img src="obliques.jpeg" alt="architecture oblique drawings">
  <blockquote> This image is an example of my ability to draw
    technical drawings. For example, these are obliqute isometrics
    at varying angles that can be used for actual measurements. </blockquote> </li>
<li>  <img src="continualdelay.jpeg" alt="Continual Delay project">
  <blockquote> This is a model that I made for my first year
    final project. The project was all about continual delay
    which essentially means that the design was made to confuse
    the viewers and users of the building as to create suspense and
    visual interest. </blockquote> </li>
<li>  <img src="jobson_house.jpeg" alt="Jobson House Project">
  <blockquote> This is my final project from the first semester of
    architecture school. It shows my ability to create a fluid
    presentation layout while displaying neat technical drawings
    to a specific scale. </blockquote> </li>
